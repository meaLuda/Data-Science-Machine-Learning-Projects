we actually code this, Let's look at the various parameters of the MPLClassifier class.\n","When defining MLP, we might consider tuning some parameter because MLP is not meant to work right out of the box so the results might be dissapointing.\n","\n","In the previous session, we saw that for MLP to work we need to define the architecture of the neurons. well, that's just one parameter we can tune. There are a couple other parameters we can play with to make sure that we get the best out of the model.\n","Here are some of the paramters\n","\n","\n","*   **Solver** : This just refers to the gradient descent we want to use in the network. MLP gives us three options;\n","  1.   **SDG** - This is our good old stochastic gradient descent.

It does well when you have a large dataset. You can read more on it in the link provided in the suggested reading section. It is said to have the best perfomance out of the three\n","\n","  1.   **lbfgs** - an optimizer in the family of quasi-Newton methods.\n","\n","\n","*   **Activation**: Here we get to define the type of activation function we want to use in our network. we can use either one of the following;\n","\n","      1.   **logistic** - used for the sigmoid function\n","      2.   **tanh** - used for the hyperbolic tan function\n","      1.   **relu** - used for the recttified linear unit\n","\n","*   **alpha**: In MLP, this is the penalty term. Just like in svm where we denoted our penalty term as c. It helps regulate cases of overfitting.\n","\n","*   **Learning_rate**: This is the learning rate for our SDG. It also has parameters;\n","\n","      1.   **Constant** - refers to a constant learning rate given by learning_rate_init\n","      1.   **invscaling** - it will gradually decrease the learning rate at every step\n","      2.   **adaptive** - this means that the network will keep the learning_rate constant  to the learning_rate _init as long as the training loss keeps decreasing\n","\n","\n","\n","*   **Learning_rate_init**: This is the initial learning rate used.
