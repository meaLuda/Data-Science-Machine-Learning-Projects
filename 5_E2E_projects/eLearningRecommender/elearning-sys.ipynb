    "<h3>Project Overview of the proposed AI Recommendation Agent</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project suggests creating a customised AI recommendation agent for e-learning that makes use of methodologies like `Item Response Theory (IRT)` and `Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)`. By offering `personalized recommendations` based on the `student's academic performance` and `learning preferences`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested method seeks to overcome the difficulty of locating relevant and interesting content on an e-learning platform. ANN will adaptively suggest learning resources based on the student's academic ability level and learning preferences after using IRT to model the student's academic ability level.\n"
